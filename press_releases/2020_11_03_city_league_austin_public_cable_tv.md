The inaugural episode will air on Thursday, November 5 at 10pm local time, and will feature the Week 7 matchup between New Mexico's Jae Hoon Lim and Colorado's Mike Hughes.

Using a suite of internet-powered software, nine players from across the United States compete via webcam to earn the title of Quarantine Premier League Champion in the competition's second running. Matches are produced and commentated on from Austin, Texas.
